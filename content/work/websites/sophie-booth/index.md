I started this project as a gift for my sister in May 2019 and spent the entire month designing and implementing my ideas. This site serves as Sophie Booth's online space for others to learn more about her and or contact her.

The aim of the design was to show off a little about her personality through the choice of specific colours and animations. 

With this aim I created a custom loading screen with a netball bouncing on top of a court before sliding down to reveal the homepage. The homepage seen above contains a fade between her favourite colours a green and blue background with a small particle effect.


{{< figure src="preloader.jpg" class="ml-md-5 px-0 mt-3 mb-5 col-12 col-md-5 text-center shadow d-inline-block" width="100%" >}}

{{< figure src="navigation.png" class="mr-md-5 px-0 mt-3 mb-5 col-12 col-md-5 float-right text-center shadow d-inline-block" width="100%" >}}

For the navigation I created a simplistic full page design. It contains links to all other pages on the site, her social media accounts and email address.
