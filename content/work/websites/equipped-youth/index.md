The Equipped Youth Manual was developed for Realive Youth from July to November 2019 as part of my final project of my Diploma in Software Development at Techtorium NZIIT. It is an online manual for equipping Christian youth in their Christian lives by containing information on how they can share, explain, encourage and deepen their faith in God.
