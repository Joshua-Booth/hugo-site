I've been developing my personal website since 2016. It's a way of displaying my work, telling people a little about myself and providing my contact details for anyone to get in touch.

With this new redesign my goals were to make it simple enough for anyone to use, a clean look, easy for myself to update and as a way to provide more information about the work I do.

Now, all my main site sections and projects are organised with their own sections or pages. It's fully responsive and resizes to any browser size correctly. The modern user interface is easy to use and navigate as the content is well organised.
