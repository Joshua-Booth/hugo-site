Originally designed to scrape text and play devotions as text to speech, the site now plays the original source audio. Built in April 2019, is used daily by my Grandad to listen to his Christian devotionals. This application provides a single, easy to use interface for those with poor/reduced eye sight, instead of navigating multiple poorly designed user interfaces to read or hear daily devotionals.

Currently contains five different devotionals:

* Charles Spurgeon - Morning & Evening
* Word For Today
* Our Daily Bread
* Today in the Word
